# Optimization of Improve your business website>

## Description



The objective of this project was to improve and optimize the functionality of the website by adding semantic elements and alt text for images, and fixin minor errors that affected the user experience. By adding all these fixes we were able to create a more accesible website for people using screenreaders ore other tools. In this project I learned the importance of prioritizing the use of semantic elements instead of div, i also learned how to identify errors or repetition that made the code look messy.
